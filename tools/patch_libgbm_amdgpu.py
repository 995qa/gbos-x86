"""Let Google's vendor libgbm.so (minigbm) allocate buffers on an AMD GPU, as plain linear dumb buffers.

  patch_libgbm_amdgpu.py IN OUT

minigbm picks a backend by comparing the DRM driver name (drmGetVersion) with each backend's `name`. Google's build
has no amdgpu backend (i915/xe/radeon/nouveau/virtgpu/vkms/... only), so gralloc fails on a Ryzen laptop. The vkms
backend is minigbm's "generic linear dumb buffer" one (every render/texture/scanout format, DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB,
nothing driver specific), and libgbm already contains an unreferenced "amdgpu" string. So the vkms backend's name pointer
(.data.rel.ro, 0x2c740; RELR relocation, the file holds the link-time address) is pointed at that string: the vkms
backend now answers to "amdgpu" and, as a side effect, no longer to "vkms" (the virtual test driver, never used here).

Only applied to the exact original (sha256 pinned): it is the offset into one specific build.
